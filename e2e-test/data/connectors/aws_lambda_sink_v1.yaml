          Send a payload to an AWS Lambda function.

          The basic authentication method for the Lambda service is to specify an access key and a secret key. These parameters are optional because the Kamelet provides a default credentials provider.

          If you use the default credentials provider, the Lambda client loads the credentials through this provider and doesn't use the basic authentication method.
