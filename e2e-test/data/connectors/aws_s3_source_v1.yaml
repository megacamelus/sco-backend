          Receive data from an Amazon S3 Bucket.

          The basic authentication method for the S3 service is to specify an access key and a secret key. These parameters are optional because the Kamelet provides a default credentials provider.

          If you use the default credentials provider, the S3 client loads the credentials through this provider and doesn't use the basic authentication method.
